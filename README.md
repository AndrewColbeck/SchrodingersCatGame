## Plot
Shrodinger's Experiment famously poses the hypothetical scenario of a cat being placed in an enclosed space with a radioactive particle.  The particle could at any time expell radiation killing the cat instantly, but until the enclosed space is opened and the cat is observed, the Cat is believed to be in two states; both dead and alive.

Help Halfpaw the cat collect enough electrons to stabilise the radioactive particle before he is observed by the security camera!
